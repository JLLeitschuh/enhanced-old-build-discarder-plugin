<div>
    Allows a user to request both quantity and age conditions be met prior to build discard.
    This means that if N max builds are set with M max age, builds will only be cleared if they exceed
    the given age <i>and</i> if their quantity exceed the N max build quantity. The feature will thus never
    allow build deletion to leave less builds than the N max builds set, or allow build deletion of builds
    under the M max age <i>regardless</i> of N max builds set.
    <b>NOTE:</b> This feature does nothing if <i>Days to keep builds</i> and/or <i>Max # of builds to keep</i> are empty.
